# Crypto-Prediction---Basic-RNN-Model
This project is based on RNN to compare the accuracy of prediction using GRU and LSTM model.
This model takes in data for a given set of days(which can be changed) and then predicts the price on a particular given day.
The main purpose of the project is to compare the accuracy of the two RNN models and to check which one works better.


This the Graph for LSTM model
